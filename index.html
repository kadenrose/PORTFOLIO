                        <h4>Objective</h4>
                        <p>Design and develop a campaign website that balances creativity with industry-standard usability—capturing attention through a compelling visual identity while clearly conveying key information to the public.</p>
                        <h4>Process</h4>
                        <p>I began by planning the site’s information architecture through research on established campaign websites. By examining the content and structure of sites belonging to well-known political figures, I determined that the website should include four key pages: Home, About, Events, and Get Involved. Each page was designed with clear user goals in mind—such as providing accessible forms for engagement and participation.<br><br>After creating wireframes and finalizing the layout, I built the site using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, focusing on usability and accessibility. I implemented interactive features like a real-time election countdown, a light/dark mode toggle, and volunteer form validation. Throughout the process, I applied responsive design principles to ensure consistent performance across all devices.<br><br>Version control was managed through GitHub. The process emphasized clean, semantic code, user-centered design, and practical problem-solving—reflecting how I approach all web development projects from concept to completion.</p>
                        <h4>Results</h4>
                        <p>The front-end included working forms, responsive layouts, and dynamic JavaScript features. The design effectively communicated the campaign’s message and guided users toward key actions such as donating and volunteering.</p>
