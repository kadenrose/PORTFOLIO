# Kaden Rose — Portfolio Website

A simple, clean, and fully hand-coded single-page portfolio website built with **HTML**, **CSS**, **Bootstrap**, and **vanilla JavaScript**.  
Created as part of a Portfolio Development course, with the goal of demonstrating front-end development skills through a professional, accessible, and intentionally minimal layout.

- Meet course requirements while demonstrating real-world development ability
- Present projects in a structured, scannable format that works well for **AI-based resume/portfolio reviewers**
